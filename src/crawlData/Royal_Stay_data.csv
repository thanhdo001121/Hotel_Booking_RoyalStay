LA CACHETTE HOME✯3'->PHỐ CỔ✯BALCONY VIEW✯LIFT✯CALM ,4 guests · 2 bedrooms · 2 beds · 1 bath,14 ,"Entire apartment in Hanoi, HN","Located in a residential area right at the city centre, you will find the La Cachette Home a perfect getaway from all the chaos of the city yet within walkable distance to all the excitement of the city life.Influenced by the mid-century theme, La Cachette Home would be an ideal place for single, families, groups of friends, couples as well as solo adventurers whether you are looking for a long-term or short-term stay.The spaceInfluenced by the mid-century interior design, the La Cachette Home is a modern & classic well-lighted studio apartment which is divided into 4 main areas:  sleeping area (2 queen-sized beds with comfy mattress), an open plan fully furnished kitchen with stove, oven, refrigerator and kitchen equipment, a living room area with internet-connected 40'' TV & a comfy sofa and , last but not least,  a spacious and clean bathroom/toilet area. (Bathroom area: about 4.5 metres squared).* Location:You can literally walk to almost every well-known attraction in Hanoi from here such as Old Quarter, Sword Lake, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, Van Mieu - Temple of Literature  just to name a few. There is a convenience store called 'Vinmart"" just a 30 seconds away from the apartment. Or if you’re a foodie then make sure you check out the lively street called ""Tong Duy Tan street"" which is one of most popular streets in Hanoi well known for many trendy cafeterias, and local restaurants, chic bars, open 24/24 again just a short walk from the apartment. Although you might find that the street is a lot less packed during Covid restriction policy, this actually allows you to pay attention to things that you rarely see during the busy times.- 12 mins walk to Hoan Kiem lake- 10 mins walk to Old Quarter- 10 mins walk to Van Mieu - Temple of Literature- 8 mins walk to Hoa Lo prison ...** What makes La Cachette Home a lovely place to stop by:- The apartment sits on 6th floor but equiped with elevator that will surely save you from the mysery of climbing stairs. This is actually a cool feature as there are not many local residential area in the central area that has a lift.- And another great thing about being on the 6th floor is that you will be kept away from all the chaos of the city yet still incredibly close to the central area where all the actions happen.- Unlimited high-speed wifi (a-must really)- 02 queen-sized beds with soft mattresses along with cotton bed sheets just to make sure you get a good night sleep before your venture into the city.- Widely windows on the side of the apartment that allow natural light to flood in.- Internet-ready TV, cool air-condition/heater and fridge.- A kitchen with fully cooking utensil, kettle; a desk & 2 chairs for working and eating.- Clean & private bathroom.- And just to top it off, there is a spacious, full of natural light balcony where you can sit around and enjoy a few beers or cups of tea with your friends.Guest accessAs soon as you have checked in, the entire place along with all the facilities (mentioned below) will be at your disposal. We will not enter to the apartment without your permission unless it is an emergency. Also please be assured that this is a self check-in/out flat so late check-in will not be an issue at all. A detailed instruction will be sent to you once you have booked the place. We will also provide you with some of our own tips on places to visit along with foods and drinks to try in Hanoi just to give you a little bit of extra help in familiarizing yourself with the city.Other things to noteThere is just a few things to note about the apartment. - First of all, the gate to the residential area where the apartment is situated is usually locked after 10.30 p.m for safety reason but you will be given a key to this gate so you can leave the apartment and come back anytime you want, as long as you remember to bring the metal key with you. For late check in, my aunt actually lives close by so she will always be available to help you check in late- Secondly, the alley leading to the elevator is a bit narrow so you might get feel a little bit strange at first but it’s actually something normal here due to the way that buildings used to be constructed in the past. Plus it’s only 5 second walk.-Finally, since the apartment is located right at the central area of Hanoi, some noises especially during the weekend is unavoidable but hopefully with our sound-proof windows, it should help minimise the noise as much as possible for your pleasant stay.","['https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/12af5318-36d9-4277-95df-62d3eace4889.jpg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/479f82d1-8ad7-4c76-9abc-14cc5f379ff9.jpg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bb5b578c-7ad3-4fa4-8198-f0175cef3853.jpg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/27d11f51-0f9d-4cd7-92fd-3770f2e06df5.jpg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d95ebebf-4945-4f03-a9f0-c18a6730b2f0.jpg?im_w=720']","['Small', 'Medium', 'Large']",2

2BED BOUTIQUE ROOM  @OLD QUARTER & HOAN KIEM LAKE ,4 guests · 1 bedroom · 2 beds · 1 bath,11 ,"Entire townhouse in Hoàn Kiếm, HN","Alley is located right at Nguyen Sieu st., only several minute walk to Hoan Kiem Lake and Dong Xuan Market, very good location and very good amenity. Will be a 'miss' if you do not experience life at the Old Quarter when visiting Hanoi. For some, however, it is a challenge finding a rather serene and comfortable place to rest after a long day exploring the city. Alleyhome will be an answer to those who are seeking cultural exchange but still want to have clean & well equipped accomodation.The spaceIMPORTANT: Unless otherwise requested, we will set up 1 bed for every booking of 2 guests!Staying at the Alley means you staying at the heart of Hanoi. This has two advantages: You live and eat like locals, but you can still find stores that sell products for tourists. From the homestay, you can walk to many tourist spots. Alley is one ten steps away from walking streets and night market. You can easily have leisure by walking in the night market. But you dont have to worry if you have a bike and come home late, since the street is not blocked for walking.  The room is locate on the 3rd floor  but the stair is very low and easy to walk. The room has big window, allowing you to enjoy the sunlight, wind and observing the life of people in the Old Quarter. It is also the closest to the rooftop and kitchen.Guest access-The room is private with full amentity including beds, private bathroom, air conditioners, cable and internet TV, wifi, fridge, toiletries, hair dryer, comb, toothbrush, handsoap, iron, umbrella, etc...-The kitchen and roof top bar are the mutual places that you can also use (each room will have a separate fridge so please keep your cooked stuff in the private fridge)Other things to note-The street gate is closed after 11.00 pm so please bring the keys with you when you intend to go home late. For guests checking in after 11.00, Alleyhome will send specific instructions for checkin.-Alley offer Japan rubber mattress for the main bed (which is very good for health). For extrabed, we can only offer cotton mattress since it is foldable in our limited storage (but we will provide mousse topper to make sure the bed is not hard to sleep on)-We are using magnetic key for the room, so after swiping the card to open the room´s doors, please put the magnetic key in the plug on the wall. Only after that, can you turn on the light.","['https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ef4e191b-bbb3-4206-beff-e4e1bcb8ace5.jpg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d6efb741-0f69-47f9-9b5c-ba093f8bcb63.jpg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/fdad68b2-bf11-40f6-9bda-886d25392b2a.jpg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d10b141c-4355-468c-8b45-a3ae62b485a8.jpg?im_w=720', 'https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/dda78bff-6f20-401e-82a9-54387a4a3366.jpg?im_w=720']","['Small', 'Medium', 'Large']",5
